## Potential Questions to Explore
* What needs to be personalized at the user level?
* Are there personalization mechanisms that can be generalized to users with similar functional abilities?
* What is the representation format of the data we wish to store in associatation with these personalizations? JSON format? Additional thoughts: (key value pairs, entire data models to differentiate between types of personalizations, etc.)
* Could there be a security or privacy impact on the storage of personalization data and how can this risk be mitigated.
* How will users express the intent to personalize?
* How can these personalizations be shared across community to maximize utility?
* What portions of these personalization tasks are subject to automation?
## Potential Projects
* Many websites involve task-focused designs, for example, a check-out flow on an e-commerce website. These types of flows are typically explicitly labeled and give the user an indication of where they are at in the flow along with the ability to navigate backward to fix errors. Some user paths may not be explicitly labeled becuase the path a user takes in navigating a website may span over multiple explicit flows. A mechanism, similiar to a breadcrumb trail, may be useful for users with memory or other cognitive impairments. 
* The scenario above gives an example of a task-focused design. Can you think of benefits associated with changing a flow from a task-focused design to an object-focused design and how that may be of specific benefit to users with cognitive or other disabilities?
* Given a text-based paragraph, build a visual tree structure that uses symbols, pictures or other visual elements which helps a user who has difficulty understanding the content from a purely text-based context.
* Think about a situation which makes you anxious, perhaps taking a test. Are there any affordances which may mitigate anxiety in a UI?
